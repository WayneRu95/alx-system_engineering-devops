## Requirements

- Understanding of web server technologies such as Apache, Nginx, and PHP.
- Familiarity with Linux command-line interface and system administration.
- Knowledge of web application deployment and configuration.

## Installation

No installation steps are required for this project. It primarily involves debugging and troubleshooting existing web stack configurations.

## Usage

To begin debugging, follow these general steps:

1. Identify the symptoms of the issue, such as error messages, performance degradation, or unexpected behavior.
2. Review server logs, configuration files, and other relevant system information to pinpoint the root cause of the problem.
3. Implement appropriate debugging techniques and solutions to resolve the issue.
4. Test the changes and verify that the problem has been resolved.

## Debugging Techniques

Some common debugging techniques include:

- Reviewing server logs (error logs, access logs).
- Checking configuration files for syntax errors and misconfigurations.
- Using diagnostic tools such as `strace`, `netstat`, `top`, and `tcpdump`.
- Inspecting system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
- Analyzing network connectivity and firewall settings.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of common issues and their debugging solutions:

1. **Apache server returning 500 Internal Server Error**:
   - Check Apache error logs (`/var/log/apache2/error.log`) for details about the error.
   - Look for syntax errors or misconfigurations in Apache configuration files (`/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`, `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*`).

2. **Nginx server unable to serve static files**:
   - Verify Nginx configuration for correct `root` directive pointing to the directory containing static files.
   - Check file permissions and ensure that Nginx has appropriate read access to the static files.
