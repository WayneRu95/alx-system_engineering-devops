Project 0x15. API
This project involves building an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows users to interact with a specified system or service programmatically. The API provides a structured way for different software components to communicate and exchange data.

Overview
The API developed in this project serves as a bridge between the frontend and backend of an application. It defines the methods and protocols that frontend applications can use to request and manipulate data from the backend server.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Choose a programming language suited for your project (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)
Web Framework: Specify the web framework used for developing the API (e.g., Flask, Express.js, Spring Boot, etc.)
Database: Identify the database technology used to store and retrieve data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)
Authentication: Describe how users authenticate and authorize their requests (e.g., JWT, OAuth, etc.)
Features
RESTful Routes: Define the RESTful endpoints available in the API (e.g., GET /users, POST /users, PUT /users/:id, DELETE /users/:id, etc.)
Data Validation: Explain how input data is validated and sanitized to ensure data integrity and security.
Error Handling: Describe how errors and exceptions are handled within the API, including appropriate HTTP status codes.
Authentication and Authorization: Detail the mechanisms used for user authentication and authorization of API requests.
Pagination and Filtering: If applicable, explain how data pagination and filtering are implemented to manage large datasets efficiently.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/WayneRu95/project-0x15-api.git
cd project-0x15-api
Install Dependencies:
bash
# Example for Node.js with npm
npm install

# Example for Python with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Environment Variables:Create a .env file based on .env.example and provide the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection URL, secret keys).
Run the Application:
bash

# Example for Node.js
npm start

# Example for Python
python app.py
Usage
Describe how to use the API, including examples of making requests to the endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or a programming language's HTTP client library.

bash
# Example: Retrieve a list of users
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/users
Roadmap
Outline future improvements and features planned for the API.

Implement user authentication using OAuth 2.0.
Add support for file uploads using multipart/form-data.
Integrate caching mechanisms to optimize performance.
