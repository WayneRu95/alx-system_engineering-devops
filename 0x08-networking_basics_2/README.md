## Description

In this project, we delve further into networking basics, exploring topics such as TCP/IP protocols, UDP, and firewall configurations. Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, we reinforce our understanding of how data is transmitted over networks and the role of various protocols in ensuring reliable communication.

## Requirements

To run the scripts and exercises in this project, you will need:
- A Unix-based operating system (Linux or macOS)
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts and Unix command-line interface

3. Explore the files and scripts included in the project to understand the networking concepts covered.

4. Execute the scripts or follow the instructions provided to complete the exercises.

## File Descriptions

- `0-localhost`: Script that displays the IPv4 address of the local machine.
- `1-wildcard`: Script that configures a Ubuntu server with the specified requirements.
- `100-port_listening_on_localhost`: Script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
- `101-greeting_server`: Bash script that sends a message to a server listening on port 98 of localhost.
- `102-port_listening_on_all_ips`: Script that listens on all active IPv4 IPs and ports in the machine.
