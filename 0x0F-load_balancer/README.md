# 0x0F. Load balancer

This repository contains solutions for the Load balancer project as part of ALX low-level systems engineering track.

## Description

The load balancer project aims to implement a basic load balancer using Nginx. Load balancers are essential components of modern web infrastructure, distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability of web applications.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project include:
- Understanding the concept of load balancing and its importance in web infrastructure.
- Configuring Nginx as a basic load balancer.
- Implementing various load balancing algorithms such as round-robin, least connections, etc.
- Testing the load balancer with different configurations and traffic loads.

## Tasks

The tasks completed in this project include:
1. **0. Double the number of webservers**: Configure Nginx to distribute traffic across two web servers.
2. **1. Install your load balancer**: Install and configure Nginx on your `lb-01` server.
3. **2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet**: Use Puppet to add a custom HTTP header to the web servers' responses.
4. **3. Add a click counter for Nginx visits**: Implement a custom module for Nginx to count visitor clicks.
5. **4. Distribute your traffic for OL web traffic #advanced**: Configure Nginx to distribute traffic for `www.olweb.es`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:
- Access to Linux-based servers (virtual machines or cloud instances).
- Nginx installed on the servers.
- Basic knowledge of web server configuration and networking concepts.
