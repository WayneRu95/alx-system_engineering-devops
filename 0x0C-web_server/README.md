Once the server is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Examples

1. Serving static content:
   
   Place your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static files in the `public` directory. The web server will serve these files to clients upon request.

2. Handling dynamic content:

   Implement dynamic content by using server-side scripting languages such as Node.js, Python, or PHP. Configure the server to execute scripts and generate dynamic responses based on client requests.
